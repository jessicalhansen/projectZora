/*              Project Zero: projectZora
                Pseudo code MVP rough draft

1. Create a Tamagotchi class - cat
    - Name - default Zora
    - Hunger: 0
    - Sleepiness: 0
    - Boredom: 0
    - Age: 0

2. Create a stats display and assign methods
    - Name 
    - Hunger: 0 --> 10 - increment by 1 every 10 seconds 
        - possibly add increment by 1 after 'playing' with cat.

    - Sleepiness: 0 --> 10 - increment every 10 seconds 
        - possibly add increment by 1 after 'playing' with cat.

    - Boredom: 0 --> 10 - increment by 1 every 10 seconds
       - possibly add increment by 1 after making cat 'sleep'. 

    - Age: 0 --> 10 - increment by 1 every 60 seconds. 


3. Create button bar and assign methods (icons in /assets/)
    - Feed --> resets hunger to 0 - animate cat happy icon
        - possibly animate fish on screen

    - Play --> resets boredom to 0 - animate cat sitting icon
        - possibly animate ball of yarn on screen

    - Sleep --> resets sleepiness to 0 - turn screen black with cat sleeping icon in middle of screen
        - possibly animate 'zzz'

4. Add start screen - click any button to start.
    - cat standing icon animation
    - possibly include 'adoption' dialogue. 

5. GAME OVER - when any stat hits 10
    - Zora runs away, animiate angry cat icon
    - except age, cat sleeping icon animates on screen instead.
